INSTALLATION
=================
Quick instructions:
-------------------
* Check out the whole project from github (https://github.com/walachey/football-worldcup-simulator-comp) with git
* Update the submodule simulation/deps
* In simulation/, run "make" or use the MSVC project
NOTE: 
	Make sure that your compiler supports some of the latest C++11 features.
	g++ 4.8.1 and MSVC 2013 work.

In short:
	git clone https://github.com/walachey/football-worldcup-simulator-comp.git
	cd <repository_directory>
	git submodule update --init --recursive
	cd simulation
	make
	
Long instructions:
------------------
* Getting the dependencies:
	The project depends on the boost and JSON-spirit libraries. 
	You can EITHER use the prepared dependencies: 
	* https://github.com/walachey/football-worldcup-simulator-deps/archive/master.zip
	
	OR use the github repository for the dependencies directly:
	* https://github.com/walachey/football-worldcup-simulator-deps
	
	OR download the dependencies manually:
	* http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.55.0/
	* http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/20027/JSON-Spirit-A-C-JSON-Parser-Generator-Implemented
	
	The dependencies have to be extracted into simulation/deps/.
	
* Building the project:
	NOTE: 
		Make sure that your compiler supports some of the latest C++11 features.
		g++ 4.8.1 and MSVC 2013 work.
		
	* Windows:
		Open the Visual Studio 2013 solution and select "Build->Build Solution".
	* Linux/MinGW:
		Run "make".


RUNNING THE SIMULATION
======================
The simulator receives its configuration and the teams' data via JSON-formatted input.
The input can either be passed via stdin or be read from a file (option "-f <filename>").
The simulator will then run as many simulations as specified in the file and output a summary of the results to stdout.

If the simulator executable is called "simulator", an example usage would be:
	* simulator -f input.json
	* simulator < input.json
